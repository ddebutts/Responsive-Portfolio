      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <img src="assets/images/DanDebutts_badgephoto3.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Dan DeButts">

      <p>I'm 20 year IT professional that enjoys solving problems and collaberating with teams to get things done. I have decided to expand my skill set by taking the full stack developer course offered by UNH.  I consider myself a life long learner that enjoys taking classes whenever I can.</p>

      <p>When I'm not coding or taking classes I'm out playing with my three boys or spending time with my lovely wife of 17 years.  We enjoy hiking, hockey, lacrosse, movies, and site seeing around where ever we can.</p>

      <p>I have been involved with and helped design many solutions through a variety of roles in my career.  I'm excited to actually finally get to do some of the coding and deliver some highly useful tools and products.</p>
